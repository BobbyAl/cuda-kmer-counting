          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 4.9 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average of  
          5.84 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.22 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 19.9 cycles being stalled waiting for sibling warps at a CTA    
          barrier. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a      
          barrier. This causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point.        
          Whenever possible, try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. If the block size is 512       
          threads or greater, consider splitting it into smaller groups. This can increase eligible warps without       
          affecting occupancy, unless shared memory becomes a new occupancy limiter. Also, try to identify which        
          barrier instruction causes the most stalls, and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point  
          first. This stall type represents about 69.8% of the total average of 28.5 cycles between issuing two         
          instructions.

    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on

          on each stall reason.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 15.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 13.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
